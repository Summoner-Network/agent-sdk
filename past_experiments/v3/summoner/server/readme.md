## Web Assembly Software Transactional Memory (WASTM)  
> WASTM is pronounced "Waste 'Em"

WASTM is a Software Transactional Memory (STM) system inspired by [BlockSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06871), adapted for WebAssembly-based smart contract execution. Like BlockSTM, it executes transactions optimistically and in parallel, resolving conflicts through a deterministic re-execution phase. However, WASTM is designed to support lightweight, embeddable runtimes — making it ideal for WebAssembly-based environments.

WASTM targets applications where **parallelism**, **determinism**, and **replayability** are critical — such as smart contracting platforms, simulations, or autonomous agent execution.

### Key Design Goals:
- **Optimistic Concurrency:** Like BlockSTM, transactions are executed speculatively in parallel under the assumption that they don't conflict.
- **Deterministic Replay:** Conflicts are resolved via re-execution using a scheduler to ensure deterministic output.
- **WASM Compatibility:** Designed for use with WebAssembly modules running in deterministic runtimes like Wasmtime or WasmEdge.
- **Low Overhead:** Lightweight implementation to support embedded and high-throughput scenarios.

### Steps to Production

#### 0. Define a gRPC client and protocol for a simple counting service.  
- This serves as a minimal, controlled workload to demonstrate correctness and concurrency behavior.
- The counting service will expose basic operations like `increment()` and `get()`, backed by STM.

➡️ See [`/summoner/client`](../client/) for client definition and usage.

#### 1. Implement an E2E correctness-checker for the counting service.  
- This tests WASTM’s ability to execute concurrent increments safely.
- The correctness checker will run thousands of transactions in parallel across multiple threads and verify:
  - Final counter values are correct (linearizable).
  - Execution remains deterministic across replays.
  - No double-counting or lost writes occur, even under high concurrency.

#### 2. Implement a single-pass one-by-one block execution loop in-memory.
- Pass the performance and correctness tests that were created.
- Map out the basic primitives and abstractions in a simple world.
- Demonstrate cross-contract call capability, at least 60 transactions/sec.
- Implement in secure, sound, and production-appropriate details.
  - Lay the foundations for assuming wild success.
